--------------------------

* Fixed text formatting to include links, moved replace_links call from the
  view_topic.pt to the format_text methog in view.py.

* Put replace_links method in the view.py for searching and replacing links in
  text area of comments. Also made tests for the method.

* Put back subject field check in view.py. Somehow it got cut in recent
  changes.

* Changed the topic and comment addable priority to 4.

* Changed the configure.zcml priority setting for Silva Forum to 4, to send
  it to the bottom of the addables list in the SMI select pulldown.

* Fixed the _generate_id method which would return 'already used id' with
  id's ending in '___2'.

* Removed old security code triggered with the Ajax version of the forum.

* Fixed the pagination links to not can the add messages. Tweaked the the
  pagination code to be more efficient.

* Put in jump for the preview form on a comment. Now when previewing the 
  comment will jump to the last page, the same page as where it is added.

* forum.css changes, added emoticon preview support to view_forum.pt,
  view_comment.pt subject fields.

  Found the error on the preview hidden inputs, and re-wrote those to
  support unicode.

* Reverted to static form in view_forum.pt view.

  functionality. Found IE issue with Ajax forms.

  code to use topic rather than thread.
