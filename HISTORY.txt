--------------------------

* forum.css changes, added emoticon preview support to view_forum.pt,
  view_comment.pt subject fields.

  support unicode.

* Reverted to static form in view_forum.pt view.

  functionality. Found IE issue with Ajax forms.

* Pagination right/leftdouble.gif are not included in Silva 2.0,
  so put them into the www/ of SilvaForum.
