=====================
Installing SilvaForum
=====================

Dependencies
------------

  * required:

    SilvaForum depends on Silva 2.0 or later, and thus requires a fully working
    Zope/Silva install

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Unpack the SilvaForum-<version>.tar.gz tarball into the Products directory in
which Silva is installed. Reboot Zope and visit http://<your host>/<silva
root>/manage_services in your browser. Click on service_extensions, find the
'SilvaForum' gray box and click the 'install' button.

IMPORTANT NOTE: to style the forum views, you will need to _manually_ copy
the contents of the file 'override.css' to your layout (in a default Silva
that can be done by _adding_ (not overwriting!) the contents of
'/silva_root/frontend.css' in the ZMI, for SilvaLayout situations you will
need to copy it to your layout CSS). This is a temporary solution, at a later
point manual merging should not be required.

For information about usage of the product, and contact information, see
README.txt.
