=====================
Installing SilvaForum
=====================

Dependencies
------------

  * required:

    SilvaForum depends on Silva 2.0 or later, and thus requires a fully working
    Zope/Silva install

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Unpack the SilvaForum-<version>.tar.gz tarball into the Products directory in
which Silva is installed. Reboot Zope and visit http://<your host>/<silva
root>/manage_services in your browser. Click on service_extensions, find the
'SilvaForum' gray box and click the 'install' button.

IMPORTANT STYLING NOTES: 
------------------------

There are two ways to style the forum product, via override.css or editing
head_inject and creating a forum.css DTML Method.

Override
To style the forum views, you will need to _manually_ copy
the contents of the file 'override.css' to your layout (in a default Silva
that can be done by _adding_ (not overwriting!) the contents of
'/silva_root/frontend.css' in the ZMI, for SilvaLayout situations you will
need to copy it to your layout CSS). This is a temporary solution, at a later
point manual merging should not be required.

Head_inject/forum.css
After creating a forum object in the SMI go to the ZMI and open the
head_inject file. Add the following tal:block to the head_inject file after
the <tal:block replace="structure model/@@set_nocache" /></tal:block>:
  
<tal:comment replace="nothing"> _______ SilvaForum CSS _______ </tal:comment>
<tal:block condition="python:model.meta_type == 'Silva Forum' 
                      or model.meta_type == 'Silva Forum Thread'
                      or model.meta_type == 'Silva Forum Comment'">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all"
    tal:define="metatypecss here/forum.css/absolute_url | nothing"
    tal:condition="metatypecss"
    tal:attributes="href metatypecss" />
</tal:block>

Save the file. Now create a DTML Method. For the id and title fill in 
forum.css, click add and edit, and delete the existing DTML stuff. Navigate
to the SilvaForum directory and find override.css. Copy
the contents of the css and paste them into the forum.css. Save the
forum.css.

For information about usage of the product, and contact information, see
README.txt.
