=====================
Installing SilvaForum
=====================

Dependencies
------------

  * required:

    SilvaForum depends on Silva 2.0 or later, and thus requires a fully working
    Zope/Silva install

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Unpack the SilvaForum-<version>.tar.gz tarball into the Products directory in
which Silva is installed. Reboot Zope and visit http://<your host>/<silva
root>/manage_services in your browser. Click on service_extensions, find the
'SilvaForum' gray box and click the 'install' button.

For information about usage of the product, and contact information, see
README.txt.
