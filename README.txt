SilvaForum
==========

What is it?
-----------

SilvaForum is a forum (or Bulletin Board System) for the Silva CMS. It allows
(registered) visitors of a Silva instance to create topics (threads, questions)
and respond to existing topics.

Installating SilvaForum
-----------------------

See INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.

Using SilvaForum
----------------

Visit the SMI (Silva Management Interface) to create a 'Silva Forum' object:
this will serve as the root of the forum. The public views of the Forum allow
(registered) clients to add threads (topics) to the forum, and comments
(messages) to the threads. The threads and comments are accessible from the
SMI for moderation and maintenance purposes.

Authentication can be invoked for the public view of the forum by going to
the SMI 'access' tab. In the pulldown menu for 'public view access
restrictions for' choose the setting 'Authenticated' and click 'set
restriction'.

Thanks
