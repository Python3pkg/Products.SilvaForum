===================
TODO for SilvaForum
===================

* do a comparison for final forum features Silva Forum against PHPbb

* change access for users to viewer

* build in java toggle for forms in thread list and comment list views

* fix bug, the right users are not being loaded in as the authors of 
  thread/comments
  might have something to do with sec_get_creator in contenty.py
  if you assign a user in the ZMI without Manager/owner rights, then
  go to the SMI and use the access tab to find the user, that users
  name will not be listed when the user adds topics or comments

* change message handling of forms to only output on no data
  did this for comments, so if no data is entered it complains
  for topic we at least need to have a subject or there is not link
  on the list page

* add a preview button to the submit forms

* throw away the empty public directory in views since public views are in 
the browser directory

* find or make good forum icons

* float right the permalink
