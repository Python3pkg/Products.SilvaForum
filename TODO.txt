===================
TODO for SilvaForum
===================

* Fix the Ajax version that has collapsible forms. Add unicode support to
  hidden input fields.

* Rig the preview form to render emoticons.

* Unify the batching code so it's the same for threads and comments, make 
  it one macro in a separate file (so it’s reusable), and using the macro 
  add pagination to the bottom of the tables too. Put it – 
  'macro_pagination.pt' – in the Silva core.

* i18n the pagination strings.

* Make the preview appear at the end of the table.

* In SMI the add list of the contents screen, "Silva Forum" appears as the
  first item. Change its position so it show up after the default content 
  types.

* Close a topic functionality to comments so that it remains public but no 
  more comments can be added.

* Close forums/topics to selected users.

* Incorporate the kupu editor.

* Get SilvaFind working with SilvaForum.

* Set user timezones.

* Specify a SilvaForum moderator role or assign it to an existing role. Add
  a moderate link in the frontend which connects to the corresponding 
  backend.

Issues
------

* Change the breadcrumb so it uses the format_text in view.py to
  retrieve emoticons

* Add an 'index' object to forum and topics, and build in interfaces for
  editing these views in the SMI. For the moment decided to take out the
  messages for topics.

* Redo graphic design for adding a topic from the view_forum.pt view.

* author registration in the smi. figured out a work around, but the real
  reason for this bug is yet to be discovered.

Bugs
----

* clicking on 'Silva Root' gives an error type: "NoViewError, no public
  view defined"
