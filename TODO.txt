===================
TODO for SilvaForum
===================

* implement date/time formatting for front-end views (Todd suggested to use
  nice formatting, different formatting for e.g. the current day, same month,
  etc.)

* emoticon support

* add default css

* in-depth analysis of PHP BB user interface as a blue-print for our
  forum

* get quoting and reply story properly defined and implemented

* subclass FiveViewable from object?

* create interfaces.py

* create interface API documentation

* threads() method and comments() methods are a bit overengineered

* handle_form -> update()

* bail-out early in update()

* consider returning a list of dictionaries with pre-processed information
  instead of context/threads

* same for context/comments
