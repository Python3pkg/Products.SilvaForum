===================
TODO for SilvaForum
===================

* Fix the Ajax version that has collapsible forms. Add unicode support to
  hidden input fields.

* Rig the preview form to render emoticons.

* Unify the batching code so it's the same for threads and comments, make 
  it one macro in a separate file (so it’s reusable), and using the macro 
  add pagination to the bottom of the tables too. Put it – 
  'macro_pagination.pt' – in the Silva core.

* i18n the pagination strings.

* Make the preview appear at the end of the table.

* In SMI the add list of the contents screen, "Silva Forum" appears as the
  first item. Change its position so it show up after the default content 
  types.

* Close a topic functionality to comments so that it remains public but no 
  more comments can be added.

* Close forums/topics to selected users.

* Incorporate the kupu editor.

* Get SilvaFind working with SilvaForum.

* Set user timezones.

* Specify a SilvaForum moderator role or assign it to an existing role. Add
  a moderate link in the frontend which connects to the corresponding 
  backend.

Issues
------

* Change the breadcrumb so it uses the format_text in view.py to
  retrieve emoticons

* Add an 'index' object to forum and topics, and build in interfaces for
  editing these views in the SMI. For the moment decided to take out the
  messages for topics.

* Redo graphic design for adding a topic from the view_forum.pt view.

* author registration in the smi. figured out a work around, but the real
  reason for this bug is yet to be discovered.

Known bugs
----------

* clicking on 'Silva Root' gives an error type: "NoViewError, no public
  view defined"

+ When adding a topic the feedback message is included in the url, *and* in the
  urls of the batch controls, so the message (e.g. "Comment added") remains
  visible as the user clicks through the batch. Including messages in the url
  is bad practice, ideally we would put the feedback message in options. 

* If adding topics or comment subjects starting or ending with emoticons, the 
  string can only be repeated three times before a bad request error occurs, 
  'The id "string___3" is invalid - it is already in use'.
