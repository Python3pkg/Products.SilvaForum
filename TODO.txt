===================
TODO for SilvaForum
===================

* do a comparison for final forum features Silva Forum against PHPbb

* change access for users to viewer

* build in java toggle for forms in thread list and comment list views

* fix bug, the right users are not being loaded in as the authors of 
  thread/comments
  might have something to do with sec_get_creator in contenty.py
  if you assign a user in the ZMI without Manager/owner rights, then
  go to the SMI and use the access tab to find the user, that users
  name will not be listed when the user adds topics or comments

* change message handling of forms to only output on no data

* add a preview button to the submit forms

* for form templates take out the "post-span" table and replace with a div

* take out the empty div holding tal content in the frontend views

* throw away the empty public directory in views since public views are in 
the browser directory

* find or make good forum icons
