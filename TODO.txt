===================
TODO for SilvaForum
===================

* add emoticons and smilies to service_resource directory

Issues
------

* Change the breadcrumb so it uses the format_text in view.py to
  retrieve emoticons

* Add an 'index' object to forum and threads, and build in interfaces for
  editing these views in the SMI. For the moment decided to take out the
  messages for threads.

* Redo graphic design for adding a topic from the view_forum.pt view.

* author registration in the smi. figured out a work around, but the real
  reason for this bug is yet to be discovered.

Bugs
----

* clicking on 'Silva Root' gives an error type: "NoViewError, no public
  view defined"
