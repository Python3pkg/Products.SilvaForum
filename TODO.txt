===================
TODO for SilvaForum
===================

Primary
-------

* fix preview so that previewed material is displayed in the form at the the
  bottom of the page

* fix re-posting of data off the list page, same happens off of the smi
  publish for a comment after hitting "apply changes" button

* fix permalink button which doesn't register new changes done from the
  smi

* fix emoticon support for subject fields in threads and comments

* need to make it so that comments can be styled from the forum.css.

Secondary
---------

* do a comparison for final forum features Silva Forum against PHPbb

* build in javaSCRIPT toggle for forms in thread list and comment list views
  done, but not yet implemented. getting the css and preview functionality
  done before implementing the javaSCRIPT

* hook in <link> tags

Issues
------

* author registration in the smi.
    - if a user adds a comment to the list and you then go to the smi the
    author is "unknown"

    - if you click on that comment in the smi and edit it, applying the
    changes, you then see the author is set properly
